# Solana Hackathon 2023 -- SolPets 

This is the official Solana Hackathon 2023 submission for our project SolPets ðŸŒˆ. 

## Project Description 
SolPets is a pet verification platform that turns your pet's information into a passport NFT to show proof-of-animal, and proof-of-ownership. SolPets aims to make record keeping easier for pet parents so that they can store important vaccination records and health information in one place and keep pet's history accessible at all times. Our goal for this project is to also help stop the illegal trafficking of endangered animals and help support animal shelters by making exclusive NFTs that can be auctioned to donate to various animal organizations. We will also generate and store NFTs for pets that are looking for homes so that families looking to adopt or support the pet in need can do so. 


## Features 
- Make pet records accessible only to people you trust
- Store your pets records in one place 
- Trade or sell NFTs to earn tokens


Deployed contracts :

## UI Wireframes 

We were inspired to make a website that would be easy to navigate and accessible to anyone. We also wanted the site to resonate with the Solana community and kept it on-brand and consistent with solana branded colors.
