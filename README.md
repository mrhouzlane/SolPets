# Solana Hackathon 2023 -- SolPets 

This is the official Solana Hackathon 2023 submission for our project SolPets ðŸŒˆ. 

## Project Description 
SolPets is a pet verification platform that will generate a pet passport NFT based on pets information to show proof-of-animal, and proof-of-ownership. SolPets aims to make record keeping easier for pet parents to store important vaccination records, health information, and pet's history they can access any time. Our goal for this project is to also help stop the illegal trafficking of exotic and endangered animals by making every NFT evaluated and signed by vetenarians, organizations, and government officials through multisign wallets. 


## Features 
- Make pet records accessible only to people you trust
- Store your pets records in one place 
- Trade or sell outdated NFTs to earn tokens

Deployed contracts :

## How it Works
